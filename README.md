# APBISBDeep
This Project is done by Eng. Abduallah Damash, and assigned to me by Asst. Prof. Dr. Meryem Erbilek as part of CNG483 (Int. to Comp. Vision) course.

If you have any issues or comments on the project, contact me on Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/engabduallah). I also provided the dataset that I used in this project so that you can try it by yourself.

Insight about the project:

Implement an age prediction system based on neural networks (NN) and evaluate it with a BioSecure Multimodal Database (BMDB) that consists of 200 subjects includes four eye images (two left and two right) for people within the age range of 18-73. Using a high-level language program, particularly Python, and common libraries such as PyTorch, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Numpy.


Enjoy it.

All rights saved, if you want to use any piece of the code, mentioning my name will be enough.
